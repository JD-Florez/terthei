paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark.

She was ostracized and persecuted but ultimately found love in the arms of a noble scholar.</p>\n<p>Kiaran was raised to be compassionate, kind, and merciful. her father taught her to denounce prejudices and fight for the weaker and the abandoned. As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

Note: Please see below the entry for “Poisonous Snake” which will suffice for the description of this creature.  Please note that “Giant” is a relative term and this creature is only giant in relative terms to its common size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Snakes rank among the most plentiful and diverse reptiles to slither across our planet's surface.  Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds.  Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article.  Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils.  While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat.  The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't Tread on Me.</strong>  Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings.  Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance.  While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them.  Snakes “smell” with their tongues!  Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues.  Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs.  Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight.  The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs.  Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins.  While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles.  Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities).

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":15,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"bgr2384jvp7z7dxe":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","xxwtknl0nil7g6og":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{"added":{"uvtlj1il0m71zkk7":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":6,"3":6,"4":1,"5":3,"6":2,"7":4,"8":6,"9":6,"10":4,"11":6,"12":3,"13":2,"14":6,"15":2},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"xCrkCMzkqSZFIPZ1":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664931210484,"lastModifiedBy":"xCrkCMzkqSZFIPZ1"}},{"_id":"bgr2384jvp7z7dxe","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","advancementOrigin":"5aq07rtobchqxgdk.9ojqd2dejdsffabi"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark. Having grown a conscious with great compassion for all living things, she could not stand to live under the depraved beliefs of the Drow. She was ostracized and persecuted but ultimately found love in the arms of a noble scholar.</p>\n<p>Kiaran was raised to be compassionate, kind, and merciful. her father taught her to denounce prejudices and fight for the weaker and the abandoned. As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged. Those who do not respond to attacks against their person or that which they hold dear only invite future attacks.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pegasus named (70 health)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>As a half-elf of Drow descent, she is oftentimes mistaken for a Tiefling or some kind of demon. She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Items of Note</h2>\n<p>She has a necklace of her father's. It is the most valuable item she owns, reminding her of her father's endless love for life and for goodness. This item is her light and her guide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A satchel with a weird/ tribal (cartoony) mask on the tapestry. Can up to 500 lbs not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark.

She was ostracized and persecuted but ultimately found love in the arms of a noble scholar.</p>\n<p>Kiaran was raised to be compassionate, kind, and merciful. her father taught her to denounce prejudices and fight for the weaker and the abandoned. As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark. Having grown a conscious with great compassion for all living things, she could not stand to live under the depraved beliefs of the Drow. She was ostracized and persecuted but ultimately found love in the arms of a noble scholar.</p>\n<p>Kiaran was raised to be compassionate, kind, and merciful. her father taught her to denounce prejudices and fight for the weaker and the abandoned. As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged. Those who do not respond to attacks against their person or that which they hold dear only invite future attacks.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pegasus named (70 health)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>As a half-elf of Drow descent, she is oftentimes mistaken for a Tiefling or some kind of demon. She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Items of Note</h2>\n<p>She has a necklace of her father's. It is the most valuable item she owns, reminding her of her father's endless love for life and for goodness. This item is her light and her guide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A satchel with a weird/ tribal (cartoony) mask on the tapestry. Can up to 500 lbs not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

her birth, Kiaran's mother ran away from the Underdark. Having grown a conscious with great compassion for all living things, she could not stand to live under the depraved beliefs of the Drow. She was ostracized and persecuted but ultimately found love in the arms of a noble scholar.</p>\n<p>Kiaran was raised to be compassionate, kind, and merciful. her father taught her to denounce prejudices and fight for the weaker and the abandoned. As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged. Those who do not respond to attacks against their person or that which they hold dear only invite future attacks.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Pegasus named (70 health)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>As a half-elf of Drow descent, she is oftentimes mistaken for a Tiefling or some kind of demon. She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Items of Note</h2>\n<p>She has a necklace of her father's. It is the most valuable item she owns, reminding her of her father's endless love for life and for goodness. This item is her light and her guide.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A satchel with a weird/ tribal (cartoony) mask on the tapestry. Can up to 500 lbs not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

She looks terrifying in broad daylight when her pale lilac skin and lilac eyes are clearly visible. She inspires fear at first but her mellow voice and kind words often assuage people. In the moonlight, she looks markedly less terrifying. Her bluish hue looks like it could be normal skin. Her lilac eyes look almost mesmerizing. Because of this, she is often hooded in the daylight arousing suspicion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Heart of Darkness</h2>\n<p>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

As a half-elf of Drow descent, her own acceptance by society has been tumultuous at times but she looks beyond this to give others the acceptance that her mother could never find in the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Allies &amp; Organizations</h2>\n<p>Kiaran is a Paladin to the Lord of Three Thunders, the Doombringer, the God Hoar. She seeks to uphold the greater good and any religion or association that believes in good, justice, and equality is immediately in her good graces. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dogma of the Droombringer: \"Uphold true and fitting justice and maintain the spirit of law, not the letter of law. Fitting recompense will always accrue for one’s actions. Violence will meet violence and evil pay back evil, but good will also come to those who do good. Walk the line of the Doombringer’s teachings, seeking retribution, but do not fall into the trap of pursuing evil acts for evil’s sake, for that way is seductive and leads only to one’s downfall. Vengeance must be sought for all injustices, and all punishments must fit the crime. Revenge is sweetest when it is sharpened with irony. All attacks must be avenged.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"paladin","levels":15,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"]},"value":{"added":{"43mg62mnzdtiavg6":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","48peijjcyzsxb2r0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"]},"value":{"added":{"kw6e5qi4uclw2kiv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fbExzwNwEAl2kW9c","0l6h61mnkw9c17mi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","l0w1vyl3gt952fx0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"]},"value":{"added":{"uh7jwkr5dgp32bp2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","tkv0okr00mco89j1":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"]},"value":{"added":{"82hq5ql6wavb80tt":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"]},"value":{"added":{"g25j3uwk3u5bnt6q":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"}},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"]},"value":{"added":{"o8otjm7jeg3chhas":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"}},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"]},"value":{"added":{"9b05ha8m1ckjp3m2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"}},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"]},"value":{"added":{"aplhdvMBbRjHf9Io":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"}},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":123,"3":123,"4":123,"5":123,"6":123,"7":123,"8":123,"9":123,"10":123,"11":123,"12":123,"13":123,"14":8,"15":4},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"ownership":{"default":0,"OMFiLanhycLMxd4M":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664948739347,"lastModifiedBy":"muz7nGYgbywBfCEk"}},{"_id":"43mg62mnzdtiavg6","name":"Divine Sense","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/eyes/human-single-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","advancementOrigin":"2da69wb6mxjwkbet.z2d0fxi8e24gradq"}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p><p>When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p><p>While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.</p><p>You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.
